/**
 * Definition of the class for fitness function evaluation
 *
 * The unique class for utilizing fitness function evaluation that is
 * available for all the used algorithmic solvers. This class implements
 * a genotype/phenotype mapping dedicated for transforming the real-valued
 * vector into the solution in problem space. In line with this, functions
 * encode() and decode() are used, where the first helps us by encoding the
 * solution in problem space into real-valued vector in genotype space, and
 * the second operates in the opposite direction. The EnergyFunction() evaluates
 * the quality of solution in the problem space.
